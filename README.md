# C-SimpleCalculator
A simple calculator that uses user inputs developed in C
It has the following functions:
-Addition
-Subtraction
-Multiplication
-Division
-Protected answer box so the answer cannot be changed

In the future I am looking to add in a few more features and some accessibility to make it easier to use or for 
people to customise the GUI so it is the way they like it.

I hope you like this basic project :)
